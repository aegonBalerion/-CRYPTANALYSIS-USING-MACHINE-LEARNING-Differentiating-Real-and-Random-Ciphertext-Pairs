# Cryptanalysis Using Machine Learning: Differentiating Real and Random Ciphertext Pairs

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) techniques to cryptanalysis, focusing on differentiating between real ciphertext pairs (from encryption algorithms like AES and XOR) and random ciphertext pairs. The objective is to demonstrate how ML can be used to uncover vulnerabilities in lightweight encryption methods, comparing them to robust encryption schemes like AES.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **pycryptodome**: For AES encryption operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the ML model.

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install numpy pycryptodome scikit-learn tensorflow
